            //      • If the marks are between 75 and 100(inclusive), assign Grade A.
            //      • For marks between 60 and 74(inclusive), assign Grade B.
            //      • For marks between 50 and 59(inclusive), assign Grade C.
            //      • For marks between 40 and 49(inclusive), assign Grade D.
            //      • If the marks are below 40, the student has failed.
            //      • Display the student's name along with their assigned grade at the end of the program.
            //      • Validate the user input so that when the user inputs a value higher than 100 and less than 0 it displays an error message.
